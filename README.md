# crservers.com — static site deploy (GitHub Actions)

Official **crservers.com** reusable workflow for sites we host: build a static export (for example Next.js `output: "export"`) and publish over **FTP/FTPS** using [SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action).

This repository is maintained by **Edenia** for the **crservers.com** hosting product. Customer application repos stay thin: they call this workflow and supply FTP secrets.

Customer repos should set **`packageManager`** in `package.json` (for example `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.15.9"`). `pnpm/action-setup` reads that field and no separate pnpm version is passed from the workflow (avoids mismatch with a pinned major in CI).

## Usage (customer repository)

Add a workflow that references this repo (pin a **tag** such as `@v1` in production instead of `@main`):

```yaml
name: Deploy static site

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: write

jobs:
  deploy-site:
    uses: edenia/crservers-static-deploy/.github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml@v1
    secrets:
      FTP_HOST: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
      FTP_USER: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
      FTP_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
      FTP_REMOTE_PATH: ${{ secrets.FTP_REMOTE_PATH }}
    with:
      site_url: ${{ vars.SITE_URL }}
```

Configure **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- **Secrets** (required): `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASSWORD`, `FTP_REMOTE_PATH`
- **Variables** (optional): `SITE_URL` — public URL such as `https://dev.example.com/` (not sensitive; shown in the deploy job summary)

Because this reusable workflow lives in **another** repository, the caller **cannot** use `secrets: inherit`. Map each secret under `secrets:` as shown above (same names on both sides).

### Required repository secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FTP_HOST` | crservers FTP/FTPS hostname — see [FTPS hostname and certificate](#ftps-hostname-and-certificate) below before assuming this is `ftp.customerdomain.com` |
| `FTP_USER` | FTP username |
| `FTP_PASSWORD` | FTP password |
| `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` | Remote directory **relative to the FTP account's jail root** — **must end with `/`**, and must **not** start with `./` (see [InterWorx paths](#interworx--crservers-ftp-paths) below; e.g. `example.com/html/`, or `/` if the FTP account is already scoped directly to the deploy folder) |

### FTPS hostname and certificate

On shared InterWorx nodes, **ProFTPd serves a single TLS certificate for the whole node** (CN matching the node's own hostname, e.g. `nodeXX.crservers.com`), not a per-domain certificate. If `FTP_HOST` is set to the customer's domain (`ftp.customerdomain.com`) or a `mail.` subdomain, FTPS certificate verification can fail or the TLS handshake can behave unpredictably depending on SNI support, even though plain FTP or an FTPS client with relaxed verification would connect fine.

**Use the node's own hostname as `FTP_HOST`** (e.g. `iwx41.crservers.com`) unless you've confirmed the customer's domain is included as a SAN on that node's certificate. Confirm with:

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect NODE_HOSTNAME:21 -starttls ftp -servername NODE_HOSTNAME 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -noout -subject -ext subjectAltName
```

If the customer's FTP account is jailed correctly, this has no effect on where files land — `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` (relative to the jail root) still controls that independently of which hostname you connect to.

### Optional repository variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SITE_URL` | Pass as `site_url` input (`vars.SITE_URL` in the caller). Used only for the workflow summary link text — **FTP deploy does not require it**. |

### Manual runs (dry run / clean deploy)

Add `workflow_dispatch` and forward booleans using string comparisons (`github.event.inputs` values are strings):

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      dry_run:
        type: boolean
        default: false
      clean_deploy:
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  deploy-site:
    uses: edenia/crservers-static-deploy/.github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml@v1
    secrets:
      FTP_HOST: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
      FTP_USER: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
      FTP_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
      FTP_REMOTE_PATH: ${{ secrets.FTP_REMOTE_PATH }}
    with:
      dry_run: ${{ github.event.inputs.dry_run == 'true' }}
      clean_deploy: ${{ github.event.inputs.clean_deploy == 'true' }}
      site_url: ${{ vars.SITE_URL }}
```

On `push`, those comparisons are false because the inputs are absent.

### Verbose logging for a real deploy

`dry_run: true` always logs verbosely, but that skips the actual upload. To get a full FTP command/response transcript on a **real** deploy (e.g. to correlate a failure against server-side FTP/TLS logs), set `ftp_log_level: verbose` and leave `dry_run` at its default (`false`):

```yaml
    with:
      ftp_log_level: verbose
      site_url: ${{ vars.SITE_URL }}
```

Available starting with the `ftp_log_level` input (not present in workflow revisions before it was added — pin a tag that includes it). Revert to the default (or omit the input) once you have the log you need, since verbose logging prints the full FTP transcript on every run.

### Callable workflow inputs (defaults)

| Input | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `node_version` | `22` | Node used for `pnpm install` / `pnpm build` on the runner |
| `install_command` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | Trusted maintainer input |
| `build_command` | `pnpm build` | Trusted maintainer input |
| `verify_command` | `pnpm run verify:static-out` | Skipped if `skip_verify: true` |
| `skip_verify` | `false` | |
| `artifact_name` | `static-out` | |
| `artifact_path` | `out/` | |
| `artifact_retention_days` | `7` | |
| `ftp_protocol` | `ftps` | |
| `ftp_local_dir` | `./out/` | Must end with `/` |
| `ftp_timeout_ms` | `1200000` | |
| `ftp_log_level` | `standard` | FTP-Deploy-Action log verbosity for real deploys - `minimal`\|`standard`\|`verbose`. Set to `verbose` to get the full FTP command/response transcript for a real (non-dry-run) deploy, e.g. to correlate against server-side FTP logs. `dry_run: true` always forces `verbose` regardless of this input. |
| `dry_run` | `false` | FTP no-op |
| `clean_deploy` | `false` | Wipes remote `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` |
| `site_url` | *(empty)* | Pass `vars.SITE_URL` from caller for summary |

## New site checklist (customer repo)

Use this when onboarding a new static or Next.js customer repository.

1. **Next.js static export** — in `next.config` (or `next.config.mjs`):
   - `output: 'export'`
   - `images: { unoptimized: true }` if the app uses `next/image`
2. **`package.json`** — `packageManager` (matches `pnpm-lock.yaml`), `verify:static-out` (e.g. `test -f out/index.html`)
3. **`public/.htaccess`** — Apache rules for shared hosting (see [below](#recommended-publichtaccess-next-static-export))
4. **Caller workflow** — `.github/workflows/deploy-static-site.yml` calling `edenia/crservers-static-deploy/.../deploy-static-site.yml@v1` with FTP secrets mapped explicitly
5. **GitHub Actions** — secrets `FTP_*`; optional variable `SITE_URL` (public URL for deploy summaries only)
6. **First deploy** — run workflow with **dry_run** once, then production; confirm the live site (not only a green Actions run)
7. **Optional contact form** — copy **`static-site-contact/`** into `public/` (or pre-provision on the server), configure SMTP per **`USERS-EASY-START.md`**

## InterWorx / crservers FTP paths

On **InterWorx** shared hosting, the FTP user is usually **chrooted to the account home** (e.g. `/home/ACCOUNT/`). [FTP-Deploy-Action](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action) treats `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` as **relative to that FTP root**, not as an absolute path on the server.

### Use a relative path (required)

| `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` value | Result |
|-------------------------|--------|
| `example.com/html/` | Correct — files land in `/home/ACCOUNT/example.com/html/` (shared FTP account jailed to the account home) |
| `/` | Correct **only** if the FTP account itself is already jailed directly to the deploy folder (e.g. a dedicated restricted FTP account created for CI, chrooted straight to `.../html/dev/`) — there is nothing left to descend into, so `/` is the whole answer |
| `./` | **Do not use** — looks equivalent to `/` but is not: FTP-Deploy-Action's underlying client walks the path segment by segment and tries to `MKD` a literal `.` directory, which InterWorx/ProFTPd correctly rejects with `550` since `.` already exists. The workflow auto-normalizes `./` → `/` and emits an `::warning::` annotation on the run, but fix the secret directly to remove the warning |
| `/home/ACCOUNT/example.com/html/` | Wrong — uploads often go outside the tree you see over SSH; Actions may still succeed |
| `/home/ACCOUNT/html/` | Wrong for the primary domain — often the account default “Test Page”, not the domain vhost |

**Rule:** Set `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` to the domain’s web root **relative to the FTP account's own jail root**, with a trailing slash and no leading `./`. Confirm in **SiteWorx** (domain → home / document root) or on the server:

```bash
# SSH (paths on disk)
ls /home/ACCOUNT/DOMAIN/html/

# After a successful deploy you should see at least:
#   index.html  _next/  .htaccess
```

### Typical layout (primary domain)

```text
/home/ACCOUNT/                 ← FTP login root
├── html/                      ← account default page (crservers “Test Page”) — usually NOT the live domain
└── DOMAIN/                    ← e.g. example.com/
    ├── html/                  ← document root for https://DOMAIN/  ← deploy here
    └── iworx-backup/
```

Some accounts use `domains/DOMAIN/html/` instead of `DOMAIN/html/`. Always take the path from SiteWorx or `ls` on the server, then express it **relative to `/home/ACCOUNT/`** in the secret.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|----------------|
| Actions deploy succeeds; live URL still shows crservers “Test Page” | Wrong `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` (wrong folder or absolute path) |
| SSH into `…/DOMAIN/html/` shows only placeholder files (`crservers-logo.*`, old `index.html`) | Deploy never hit that directory — fix path and redeploy |
| `find /home/ACCOUNT -name '_next' -type d` finds `_next` under `html/` or a nested `home/…` path | Stray upload from an absolute path — safe to delete after fixing the secret |
| Deploy fails with `read ECONNRESET (data socket)` right after the first “creating folder” log line, even though FTPS/TLS login clearly succeeds | `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` is set to `./` instead of `/`. Server-side logs show a clean TLS login followed by `MKD .../. ` → `550` — the action tries to create a literal `.` directory, which InterWorx/ProFTPd rejects. Not a firewall/TLS/passive-port issue. The workflow now auto-normalizes this (check the run's `::warning::` annotations) — update the secret to `/` to remove the warning |
| `ECONNRESET (data socket)` persists with `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` already correct (`/`, no leading `./`), and `ftp_log_level: verbose` shows no FTP command/response transcript at all | `log-level: verbose` only prints FTP-Deploy-Action's own sync-decision logging (“creating folder X”, “uploading file Y”) — it does **not** expose the underlying `basic-ftp` library's raw protocol trace. See [FTP protocol diagnostics](#ftp-protocol-diagnostics) below for a standalone workflow that does |

**Verify the correct folder:** after deploy, `index.html` in the domain `html/` should be small (static export) and include `_next/`. Check the public URL `Last-Modified` or page title changes.

**Verify the public site:** `curl -sI https://DOMAIN/ | grep -i last-modified` and confirm content matches the app (not the default hosting page).

### FTP protocol diagnostics

FTP-Deploy-Action's `log-level: verbose` is scoped to the `@samkirkland/ftp-deploy` package's own sync logic — it never surfaces the raw FTP command/response exchange (confirmed against upstream: [SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action#529](https://github.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action/issues/529)). When a failure needs correlating against server-side FTP/TLS logs (e.g. an `ECONNRESET` whose cause isn't one of the known ones above), use a standalone diagnostic workflow that talks to `basic-ftp` (the library the action wraps) directly, with its own protocol tracing enabled:

```yaml
name: 🔍 FTPS diagnostic
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  ftp-diagnostic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        variant: [exact-repro, latest-v6]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v7
        with:
          node-version: 24

        working-directory: ${{ env.DIAG_DIR }}
        run: |
          # Verified directly from FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.4.0's own package-lock.json -
          # this is the exact version bundled into that release's dist/index.js.
          # If you're pinned to a different FTP-Deploy-Action tag, re-check its

        run: |
          echo "[diag] variant=${{ matrix.variant }} basic-ftp=$BASIC_FTP_VERSION"
          cat <<'EOF' > ftp-diag.mjs
          import { Client } from "basic-ftp";
          import { Readable } from "stream";

          const client = new Client(30000);
          client.ftp.verbose = true; // raw protocol trace; PASS is auto-redacted by basic-ftp

          const testDir = process.env.RUN_TAG; // unique per run/matrix leg, safe to create+remove
          const testFile = "diag-test.txt";

          try {
            console.log(`[diag] connecting to ${process.env.FTP_HOST} (ftps, cert verification ON)`);
            await client.access({
              host: process.env.FTP_HOST,
              user: process.env.FTP_USER,
              password: process.env.FTP_PASSWORD,
              secure: true,
              secureOptions: {
                rejectUnauthorized: true,
                servername: process.env.FTP_HOST,
              },
            });

            const remoteDir = (process.env.FTP_REMOTE_PATH || "/").replace(/\/$/, "") || "/";
            console.log(`[diag] cd ${remoteDir}`);
            await client.cd(remoteDir);

            console.log(`[diag] ensureDir ${testDir}`);
            await client.ensureDir(testDir);

            console.log("[diag] uploading a small test file into it");
            const body = Readable.from([`diagnostic upload ${new Date().toISOString()}\n`]);
            await client.uploadFrom(body, testFile);

            console.log("[diag] SUCCESS - cleaning up this run's test folder only");
            await client.cd("..");
            await client.removeDir(testDir);
          } catch (err) {
            console.error("[diag] FAILED:", err);
            process.exitCode = 1;
          } finally {
            client.close();
          }
          EOF
          node ftp-diag.mjs
```

Notes:

- **Isolated dependency directory** (`mktemp -d` + fresh `npm init`) so this never touches the caller repo's own `package.json`/`node_modules`.
- **Unique remote test folder per run and matrix leg** (`diag-<run_id>-<attempt>-<variant>`) so concurrent runs/legs can't interfere with each other's upload or cleanup, and cleanup only ever removes the exact folder+file this run created.
- **`basic-ftp`'s built-in verbose trace redacts `PASS`** (`> PASS ###`) automatically — no extra redaction needed beyond GitHub's own secret masking.
- **FTPS and full certificate verification are preserved** (`secure: true`, `rejectUnauthorized: true`, explicit `servername`) — this diagnostic does not relax security to get a trace.
- To find the exact `basic-ftp` version bundled by a *different* pinned `FTP-Deploy-Action` tag, don't rely on resolving `@samkirkland/ftp-deploy`'s semver range today (a newer patch may have been published since that tag was built). Instead check the actual pinned entry:
  ```bash
  curl -sS "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action/<TAG>/package-lock.json" \
    | grep -A2 '"node_modules/basic-ftp"'
  ```

## Publishing (Edenia / crservers.com)

Canonical remote:

`git@github.com:edenia/crservers-static-deploy.git`

### Repo already exists on GitHub (empty or with a README)

From your local clone of this directory:

```bash
cd crservers-static-deploy
git remote add origin git@github.com:edenia/crservers-static-deploy.git   # skip if origin already set
git branch -M main
git add -A && git status
git commit -am "crservers.com static site deploy reusable workflow"   # if you have local changes
git push -u origin main
git tag v1 && git push origin v1
```

If GitHub created a first commit (for example a default `README.md`) and `git push` is rejected, run `git fetch origin` and either merge with `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories` and resolve conflicts, or coordinate with your team before any force push.

### Create the repo from scratch with GitHub CLI

```bash
cd crservers-static-deploy
git init
git add .
git commit -m "crservers.com static site deploy reusable workflow"
gh repo create edenia/crservers-static-deploy --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
git tag v1 && git push origin v1
```

Use a **public** repo if customer sites live in other GitHub orgs or accounts; otherwise callers cannot resolve `uses: edenia/crservers-static-deploy/...` unless you rely on Enterprise or org access you already control.

## What runs where

- **GitHub Actions:** Node runs only on the **runner** to install dependencies, run `next build`, and upload `out/` over FTP. Official actions are pinned to **v5+** / **FTP-Deploy v4.4+** so they use the **Node 24** action runtime (avoids the Node 20 deprecation on GitHub-hosted runners).
- **crservers (production):** Only the **static files** under your `FTP_REMOTE_PATH` are needed — typically **Apache** serves `index.html`, assets, and `.htaccess`. **You do not need Node.js on the hosting account** for this setup.

### Contact forms (SMTP mail for static sites)

Static exports cannot send mail from the browser alone. For **contact / inquiry forms**, crservers hosts a small **PHP + PHPMailer** endpoint that authenticates to an **InterWorx mailbox** over SMTP.

| Piece | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Canonical bundle | **`static-site-contact/`** in this repo |
| Edenia ops (rsync / pre-provision) | **`static-site-contact/README-EDENIA-OPS.md`** |
| Customer setup | **`static-site-contact/USERS-EASY-START.md`** → `install-on-server.sh`, then **`../private/smtp.config.php`** (or env vars) |
| Front-end contract / v0 prompt | **`static-site-contact/V0-FORM-PROMPT.md`**, **`OPERATOR.txt`** |

**Deploy with the static site:** copy `contact.php`, `composer.json`, and `composer.lock` into the app’s **`public/`** so `pnpm build` places them in **`out/`** and the [FTP workflow](#usage-customer-repository) uploads them to the domain `html/` (see [InterWorx paths](#interworx--crservers-ftp-paths)). On the server, run **`composer install --no-dev`** once in that directory (or use **`install-on-server.sh`** after Edenia pre-copies the bundle).

**Secrets:** never commit SMTP passwords. Use **`~/private/smtp.config.php`** and/or hosting env vars (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_TO`, optional `TURNSTILE_SECRET`). Optional **Cloudflare Turnstile** for public forms.

Customer repos may mirror the bundle under **`utils/contact-form/`**; treat **`static-site-contact/`** here as the source of truth (`CANONICAL-SOURCE.txt`).

### Recommended `public/.htaccess` (Next static export)

Commit this next to your app as **`public/.htaccess`** so it is copied into **`out/.htaccess`** on build. Directives are wrapped in **`IfModule`** so missing modules do not break the site.

```apache
# Static Next export on Apache (crservers / shared hosting)
DirectoryIndex index.html
Options -Indexes

# Compression when the host has mod_deflate (no-op if missing)
<IfModule mod_deflate.c>
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css application/javascript application/json
  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/svg+xml
</IfModule>

# Long cache for Next.js fingerprinted assets under /_next/static/
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  <LocationMatch "^/_next/static/">

  </LocationMatch>
</IfModule>

  ExpiresByType font/woff "access plus 180 days"
</IfModule>
```

## Versioning

Tag stable commits (for example `v1`, `v1.0.0`) and pin customer workflows to that tag instead of `@main`.

## Security

- Do not pass untrusted user input into `install_command`, `build_command`, or `verify_command`.
- `clean_deploy` deletes the entire remote `FTP_REMOTE_PATH`; use only for intentional full resets.

## License
